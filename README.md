## üì¶ Assumptions

* The `products` data passed to the component includes:

  * `id`, `name`, `price`, `image`, `brand`, `features`, and optional metadata like `description`, `stock`, `dimensions`, `warranty`, and `shipping`.
* The `features` array is an array of objects:
  Example:

  ```js
  features: [
    { name: "Battery Life", value: "20 hours" },
    { name: "Rating", value: "4.7 (8,500 reviews)" },
    { name: "Category", value: "electronics" },
    { name: "Connectivity", value: "Bluetooth 5.2" },
  ]
  ```
* All features are dynamically extracted and compared even if some products are missing them.
* Product removal is handled via `onRemove(productId)` callback function.
* The parent component manages product selection state.
